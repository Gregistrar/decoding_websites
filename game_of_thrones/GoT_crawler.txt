First we are going to run the following command in the terminal
to enter the Scrapy environment.
    > scrapy shell

Then we can fetch a bunch of data from the GoT subreddit.
    > fetch("https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/")

Look at the website that this data is using:
    > view(response)

View the URL of the response
    > response.url

Look at the long form of this data using:
    > print response.txt

Now let's make a list of things we want to extract:
    - Title of each post
    - Number of votes it has
    - Number of comments
    - Time of post creation

Extracting Titles
Scrapy provides ways to extract information from HTML based
on css selectors like class, id etc. Let’s find the css
selector for title, right click on any post’s title and
select “Inspect” or “Inspect Element”:
    - We can see the css class 'title' is applied to all the
    <p> tags that have titles.
    > response.css(".title::text").extract()
